==== NAME ====

HTML::KhatGallery::Plugin::SortNaturally - Plugin for khatgallery to use
Natural sort for index lists.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.01'' of HTML::KhatGallery::Plugin::SortNaturally.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This is a plugin for khatgallery to use Natural sort for index lists.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Test::More
    HTML::KhatGallery
    Sort::Naturally


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules.

Therefore you will need to change the PERL5LIB variable to add
/home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
